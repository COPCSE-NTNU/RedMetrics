# Web Service API

All communication between the server is done via JSON by default, although the client can request data in different formats (see the Data Formats section below). Following RESTful architecture, GET is used only to request data, POST creates resources, PUT replaces them, and DELETE removes them.

The database should be protected against SQL Injection

## Use Cases

This is a list of example requests that shows the features of the API. The meaning of the requests and their parameters are explained in later sections.

* A game developer registers a game:

 * POST /v1/game/
{ "name": “My awesome game”, “description”: “A great game by me” }

 * The developer holds onto adminKey for further use

* The game developer registers a version of the game

 * POST /v1/game/1/version/
{ "name": “1.0”, “description”: “First public version” }

* A game wants to start tracking a given player identified by mr@science.com:

 * They look if the player is already registered

  * GET /v1/player/email/mr@science.com

  * If the server returns 404, the player must be new. 

 * The game registers the player.

  * POST /v1/player

{ "email": “[bob@bob.com](mailto:bob@bob.com)” }

## Endpoints

Shared across all versions:

* /status

 * GET - Returns the Status of the server. 

Version 1:

* /v1/player/

 * GET - Lists PlayerMeta objects for all players who have ever used the service (see section on Paging below). Can be filtered by the following query parameters:

  * email - Email. This is the way to search for registered players by their email address.

 * POST - Creates a new anonymous player and returns the server-generated ID.

* /v1/player/:playerId

 * GET - Retrieves the PlayerMeta for the identified player

 * PUT - Updates the PlayerMeta. Will attempt to merge the sent information with the stored information.

* /v1/game

 * GET - Lists the games using the service as GameMeta objects (see section on Paging below)

 * POST - Creates a new game. A GameMeta object should be sent in the body. The Location response header will contain the URL for the new game. The response body contains the unique AdminKey.

* /v1/game/:gameId

 * GET - Retrieves information about the game with that Id as a GameMeta object

 * PUT - Updates game information with the provided GameMeta. The AdminKey must be sent with the adminKey parameter.

* /v1/game/:gameId/version

 * GET - Lists versions of the the game with that Id as GameVersionMeta objects (see section on Paging below)

 * POST - Creates a new version of the game. A GameVersionMeta object should be sent in the body. The AdminKey must be sent with the adminKey parameter. The Location response header will contain the URL for the new game. 

* /v1/game/:gameId/version/:versionId

 * GET - Retrieves information about the game version as a GameVersionMeta object

 * PUT - Updates game information with the provided GameVersionMeta. The AdminKey must be sent with the adminKey parameter. 

* /v1/group

 * GET - Lists the group as GroupMeta objects (see section on Paging below)

 * POST - Creates a new group. A GroupMeta object should be sent in the body. The Location response header will contain the URL for the new group.

  * afterUserTime - Date

  * beforeUserTime - Date

 * POST - Adds more progress information sent with the Progress object, or array or Progress objects. The gameId, playerId, and adminKey query parameters are required. The groupId parameter is optional. Since the progress object cannot be addressed by itself, no Location header will be returned.

## Paging

Since a large number of values can be returned via GET requests for lists, a paging mechanism is put in place. The list is included in a JSON object that also specifies the index of the first item returned (start), the number of items returned in the response (count), and the total number of items recorded (total). For example, the third page of 50 items from a total of 213 items would look like this:

{ 

  start: 100,

  count: 50,

  total: 213,

  data: [ … ]

} 

To retrieve the next page of data, the client simply sends the start query parameter set to the next page (150 in this example). The count query can also be sent, but the server may not allow the count to exceed a certain maximum value.

## Data Formats

By default, all data is sent by the server in JSON. To request data in another format, the client can send the Accepts header along with the request, or use the "format" query parameter with the format shortcode. The following formats are provided:

* Comma-separated values (CSV) 

 * MIME type: text/csv

 * Shortcode: csv 

* Tab-separated values (TSV) 

 * MIME type: text/tab-separated-values

 * Shortcode: tsv

* JSON

 * MIME type: application/json

 * Shortcode: json

* XML

 * MIME type: application/xml

 * Shortcode: xml

Whenever data is sent in a format other than JSON, the paging features do not apply.

The server attempts to compress all transmissions when allowed by client.

## HTTP status codes

HTTP status codes are treated in the following way:

* 200s - Success

 * 200 OK - A successful request that returned data

 * 201 Created - A successful request that created a resource. The Location header should contain the URL of the new resource.

 * 204 No Content - A successful request that does not return data.

* 400s - Client error

 * 400 Bad Request - The request was formatted incorrectly (e.g. the data contained in the request was not valid JSON).

 * 401 Not Authorized - The access credentials were not sent or are incorrect. 

 * 404 Not Found - The URL does not correspond to a valid resource.

 * 409 Conflict - The resource modification would put the system into an invalid state.

* 500s - Server error

 * 500 Internal Server Error - The server has a bug. Impossible, of course!

## Cross-Origin Request (CORS)

To ease integration with browser-based games, the server will send back the appropriate CORS headers allowing contacting it from any site (or perhaps only those whitelisted).

## Error Messages 

All responses with HTTP error codes should have an Error object in their body.
