# Web Service API

All communication between the server is done via JSON by default, although the client can request data in different formats (see the Data Formats section below). Following RESTful architecture, GET is used only to request data, POST creates resources, PUT replaces them, and DELETE removes them.


## Use Cases

This is a list of example requests that shows the features of the API. The meaning of the requests and their parameters are explained in later sections.

* A game developer registers a game:

    * POST /v1/game/ `{ "name": “My awesome game”, “description”: “A great game by me” }`

    * The developer holds onto adminKey for further use

* The game developer registers a version of the game

    * POST /v1/gameVersion/ `{ "game": "1234", "name": “1.0”, “description”: “First public version” }`

* A game wants to start tracking a new player:

   * POST /v1/player `{ "country": "France", gender: "MALE" }`

   * The server returns the player’s unique ID

## Data Types

* Date - String containing date and time, following the ISO 8601 Extended format. It looks like `2015-01-27T09:44:32.418Z`. All times are in UTC, and include milliseconds.

* Id - String containing a server-generated unique identifier.

* AdminKey - String containing a password unique for each game, needed for game-specific requests.

    * postalCode - String

    * gender - String (either "MALE", "FEMALE", or "OTHER")

    * externalId - String that can be set by developers in order to link the player with another database. This _must not_ be a personally identifiable marker such as an email address.

    * customData - String containing JSON data associated with the player. This _must not_ be a personally identifiable marker such as name or exact address.

* GameMeta - Object with the following properties (all are optional, except id and name)

## Paging

Since a large number of values can be returned via GET requests for lists (such as a list of events, or snapshots), RedMetrics only returns a page of results at a time. The server returns a number of header fields that describe the what page has been requested, how many pages there are, and how many results per page: 

    * `X-Total-Count` - The number of results that fit the query.
    * `X-Page-Count` - The total number of pages.
    * `X-Per-Page-Count` - The number of results per page. 
    * `X-Page-Number` - The current page (page numbering starts at 1). 
    * `Link` - The link header provides URLs that allow you to access the first, next, previous, and last pages. The link header looks like this: `http://api.redwire.io/v1/game/?&page=0&perPage=3; rel=first, http://api.redwire.io/v1/game/?&page=1&perPage=3; rel=prev, http://api.redwire.io/v1/game/?&page=3&perPage=3; rel=next, http://api.redwire.io/v1/game/?&page=172&perPage=3; rel=last`

To request a given page of data, use the `page` and `perPage` parameters. The `page` is the (1-based) number of the page requested. The `perPage` parameter is number of results desired per page. 


## Data Formats

By default, all data is returned by the server in JSON. To request data in another format, the client can send the Accepts header along with the request, use the "format" query parameter with the format shortcode, or end their request with a dot followed the shortcode, such as `/v1/games.csv`. The following formats are provided:

* JSON

    * MIME type: application/json

    * Shortcode: json

* Comma-separated values (CSV) 

    * MIME type: text/csv

    * Shortcode: csv 

The server attempts to compress all transmissions when allowed by client.

It is not possible to _send_ data to the server in a format other than JSON, however.


## HTTP status codes

HTTP status codes are treated in the following way:

* 200s - Success

    * 200 OK - A successful request that returned data

    * 201 Created - A successful request that created a resource. The Location header should contain the URL of the new resource.

    * 204 No Content - A successful request that does not return data.

* 400s - Client error

    * 400 Bad Request - The request was formatted incorrectly (e.g. the data contained in the request was not valid JSON).

    * 401 Not Authorized - The access credentials were not sent or are incorrect. 

    * 404 Not Found - The URL does not correspond to a valid resource.

    * 409 Conflict - The resource modification would put the system into an invalid state.

* 500s - Server error

    * 500 Internal Server Error - The server has a bug. Impossible, of course!


## Cross-Origin Request (CORS)

To ease integration with browser-based games, the server will send back the appropriate CORS headers allowing contacting it from any site (or perhaps only those whitelisted).

## Error Messages 

All responses with HTTP error codes should have an Error object in their body.
